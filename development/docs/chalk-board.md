## Random thoughts / ideas

### 02/11/2025
- SMIRROR: An obfuscating concept to hiding data in the segOP load from public view. Via cryptography/steganography? Could this alleviate the strain bitcoin is facing for CSAM?
- SPRUNING: Pruning options of segOP could remove node operators ethical worries and legal liability of CSAM / illegal content.
### 03/11/2025
- Another thouht! Besides spam, and sig issues, quantum computing is probably the biggest threat to Bitcoin. segOP data lane could be utilised to assist here. The pubkey and sigs are a weak point. We could use PQ signatures to combat it. If we use the segWit to carry a commitment (hash/Merkle) to the PQ sig. Then use segOP lane to carry the PQ paylaod.
- Quantum sigs will need to be added. It's only a matter of time.
### 04/11/2025
- Qsig on a hyper chain wrapped in segOP. Brain storming this via Hyper Hash.
### 05/11/2025
- Qsig / Hypr Pay / 10 second chain / Vault with Qrx and Qtx channels / Balance reconciliation at channel min/max or epoch or vault close warning.
### 07/11/2025
- Build a segOP wallet that can be used to input data into segOP tx easily.
- Include option to pull/view tx segOP data.
- Possible avenue for building economic/pruning testing modal within wallet.
- If wallet is web-based we could provide link for others to trial.
### 09/11/2025
- Add wallet check, load, create via wallet app?
- Add mine tx for reg test / check confirms.
- List network tx.
- Introduce back testing modal?
- Check current mean trend of fees versus potential segOP fees.
