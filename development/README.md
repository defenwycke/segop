# Development Area — Work in Progress

> **Warning:** Everything in this folder is under **active development**.  
> It is **dynamic, experimental, and subject to rapid change** — sometimes hourly.  
> Concepts may evolve, code may break, and half-baked ideas will absolutely appear.

## What This Folder **IS**...

This space represents the living process of building and testing new ideas.  
Files here are often prototypes, sketches, drafts, or test harnesses — not final designs.

Expect:
- Incomplete specs and placeholder text
- Rapid iteration and breaking changes
- Dead ends, rewrites, and occasional bad ideas
- Internal notes that may contradict each other

## What This Folder Is **NOT**

- Production-ready  
- Reviewed or approved  
- Stable, canonical, or final  

If you’re looking for stable releases or official specs, check the `/peer-review/` directory and even then make sure it doesnt state `draft`!

## How to Read This

You’re welcome to explore and follow the evolution of ideas here —  
just **don’t judge the unfinished product by its rough drafts.**  
Innovation is messy, and this folder embraces that chaos intentionally.

## Status

Chaotic at best.

**TL;DR:**  
This folder is the workshop, not the launchpad. Enter with curiosity, not expectations.
