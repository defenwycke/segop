## Experiment Specification — Implementing segOP in Bitcoin Core

### Overview
segOP (Segregated OP_RETURN) is a proposed Bitcoin protocol extension that introduces a dedicated, fully-fee-paying data lane, modeled after SegWit’s segregated witness structure.  
This experiment aims to design, implement, and validate segOP through regtest and mainnet trials, verifying its technical integrity, economic soundness, and backward compatibility with legacy nodes.

---

### Objectives

1. **Integrate segOP into Bitcoin Core**  
   Implement segOP parsing, serialization, and validation within the consensus stack, beginning with the coinbase transaction, positioned logically after SegWit.

2. **Expose RPC Utilities**  
   Provide user-accessible RPCs to encode, decode, and inspect segOP payloads, supporting developer testing and block introspection.

3. **Validate Backward Compatibility**  
   Demonstrate that non-segOP (legacy) nodes fully ignore segOP lanes, maintaining canonical transaction behavior and consensus safety.

4. **Enable segOP Communication Between Nodes**  
   Prove that two segOP-enabled nodes can successfully transmit, receive, and extract payloads, establishing a bidirectional data path.

5. **Implement Pruning Levels for segOP Data**  
   Test storage reduction techniques (partial, full, and archive modes) to validate data lifecycle management and node scalability.

6. **Execute a “Genesis segOP Transaction”**  
   Craft and broadcast a symbolic segOP transaction directed to Satoshi’s known address, confirming payload extraction on independent segOP nodes.

7. **Model Network Economics**  
   Simulate mass segOP traffic to evaluate the economic equilibrium between blockspace usage, miner fee revenue, and network overhead.

8. **Forecast Blockchain Growth**  
   Estimate long-term storage implications of large-scale segOP adoption under various data retention and pruning policies.

9. **Publish Results**  
   Document all implementation details, experiments, and results in a peer-reviewable technical paper (segOP White Paper).

### Work Plan / Tasks

#### Phase 1 — Foundations
1. **Define TLV Format**  
   - Establish segOP Type-Length-Value structure for consistent data framing.  
   - Specify versioning, allowed types, and size constraints.

2. **Implement Core Flags & Functions**  
   - Introduce `-segop` configuration flag and policy controls.  
   - Implement encode/decode functions (`Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `BuildSegopSection`).

3. **Integrate segOP into Coinbase**  
   - Embed segOP payload within `CMutableTransaction` during block assembly.  
   - Validate coinbase serialization and commit inclusion in the merkle tree.

---

#### Phase 2 — Functional Testing (Regtest)
4. **Mine segOP Transaction**  
   - Use regtest to mine a block containing a segOP-tagged coinbase transaction.  
   - Verify payload extraction via RPC.

5. **Cross-Node Transmission**  
   - Send segOP transaction from segOP node to legacy node.  
   - Observe acceptance and ensure no consensus conflict or rejection.

6. **Payload Extraction on Legacy Node**  
   - Confirm that a non-segOP node simply stores the transaction and ignores the payload, verifying backward compatibility.

---

#### Phase 3 — Policy & Economics
7. **Implement Fee Weighting and Lane Rules**  
   - Assign full 4 weight units per segOP byte (no SegWit discount).  
   - Test mempool acceptance, block size effects, and miner profitability.

8. **Integrate Pruning Controls**  
   - Add `-prunesegop` and `-keepsegopcommitments` flags.  
   - Evaluate storage reduction impact at block and transaction levels.

9. **Review and Align Policies**  
   - Cross-check with mempool, relay, and script policies.  
   - Ensure segOP data cannot bypass spam controls or feerate requirements.

---

#### Phase 4 — Public Validation
10. **Broadcast Genesis segOP Transaction (Mainnet)**  
    - Construct a symbolic first segOP message to Satoshi’s address.  
    - Verify receipt and extraction by other segOP nodes.

11. **Economic Simulation**  
    - Model transaction frequency, block utilization, and revenue under different segOP adoption rates.  
    - Output miner revenue curves and user cost implications.

12. **Storage Forecast Modeling**  
    - Estimate blockchain growth with and without pruning over multi-year scenarios.  
    - Project hardware and archival cost trends.

---

#### Phase 5 — Finalization
13. **Code Review and Cleanup**  
    - Standardize source comments, namespaces, and serialization functions.  
    - Remove experimental stubs and align with Core coding guidelines.

14. **Documentation and Publication**  
    - Author the **segOP Technical Paper**, summarizing goals, implementation, testing, and projected outcomes.  
    - Publish under the Hyper Hash project for open review and community testing.

### Expected Deliverables
- Modified Bitcoin Core (segOP build)
- RPC interface for segOP encoding/decoding
- Regtest demonstration and reproducible scripts
- Economic and storage modeling datasets
- segOP White Paper (v1.0)
