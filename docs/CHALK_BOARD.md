## Random thoughts / ideas

- Whilst trying to sleep last night i had multiple ideas that could help and also ruin segOP.
- SMIRROR: An obfuscating concept to hiding data in the segOP load from public view. Via cryptography/steganography? Could this alleviate the strain bitcoin is facing for CSAM?
- SPRUNING: Pruning options of segOP could remove node operators ethical worries and legal liability of CSAM / illegal content.
