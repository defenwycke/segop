- SMIRROR: An obfuscating concept to hiding data in the segOP load from public view. Via cryptography/steganography? Could this alleviate the strain bitcoin is facing for CSAM?
- SPRUNING: Pruning options of segOP could remove node operators ethical worries and legal liability of CSAM / illegal content.

- Another thouht! Besides spam, and sig issues, quantum computing is probably the biggest threat to Bitcoin. segOP data lane could be utilised to assist here. The pubkey and sigs are a weak point. We could use PQ signatures to combat it. If we use the segWit to carry a commitment (hash/Merkle) to the PQ sig. Then use segOP lane to carry the PQ paylaod.
